## Prerequisite

- Make sure that [`Vansah`](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1224250/vansah-test-management-for-jira?tab=overview&hosting=cloud) is installed in your Jira workspace
- You need to Generate Vansah [`connect`](https://docs.vansah.com/docs-base/generate-a-vansah-api-token-from-jira-cloud/) token to authenticate with Vansah APIs.
- Your Automation Project requires Java JDK version 8 or newer.
- You need to add Apache Commons Lang, and Unirest into your Maven project [pom.xml](#dependencies) .


## Configuration

- Download/Copy the latest Vansah Binding Java [VansahNode.java](/src/main/java/com/vansah/VansahNode.java) file and extract it into your maven project under test package.
- Now You need to provide your Vansah [`connect`](https://docs.vansah.com/docs-base/generate-a-vansah-api-token-from-jira-cloud/) token into your VansahNode.java file.
    - We have two options : 
	    - Add Directly into VansahNode.file
		    ```Java

			public class VansahNode {
			
			/**
			 * The authentication token required for making requests to the Vansah API. This token
			 * authenticates the client to the Vansah system, ensuring secure access to API functions.
			 * Replace "Your Token Here" with the actual token provided by Vansah. 
			 * Note that this token should be kept confidential to prevent unauthorized access to the API.
			 */
				private static String VANSAH_TOKEN = "Your Token Here";
			
			}
			
		    ```
	    - Use Setter functions to add the token
	         ```Java
	         
	         
	           VansahNode app = new VansahNode(); //Instance of VansahNode app
	         
	         /**
	             * Sets the Vansah API authentication token to the specified value. This method allows for
	             * dynamically updating the token used for authenticating requests to the Vansah API. 
	             * Changing the token can be necessary if the current token expires or if switching to 
	             * a different Vansah environment.
	       */

			app.setVansahToken("Add your Token here");
			
			/**
	 			* Sets a custom URL for the Vansah APIs. 
	 		*/
			app.setVansahURL("Your Vansah API URL") //Obtain your Vansah Connect URL from Vansah Settings > Vansah API Tokens
			
		    ```

        //Add logs for each step function without screenshot(ResultID, ActualResultComment , TestStepID);  
        apptest.addTestLog("passed", "Website loaded successfully",1);

        }catch(Exception e){
        
        //Updates an existing test log with new information or failure screenshot when there is any Exception
        apptest.updateTestLog("failed","Failed to load the website URL",screenshotFile);
        }


        // Step 2: Enter credentials and submit the form
        WebElement usernameInput = driver.findElement(By.id("username"));
        WebElement passwordInput = driver.findElement(By.id("password"));
        WebElement loginButton = driver.findElement(By.id("loginButton"));
    
        try{
        usernameInput.sendKeys("your_username");
        passwordInput.sendKeys("your_password");
        loginButton.click();
        
        //Add logs for each step function with screenshot(ResultID, ActualResultComment , TestStepID, File Screenshot);  
        apptest.addTestLog("passed", "As expected, User is able to enter the username and password",2,screenshotFile);

        }catch(Exception e){
        
        //Updates an existing test log with new information or failure screenshot when there is any Exception
        apptest.updateTestLog("failed","User is not able to click on Login Button",screenshotFile);
        }


        // Step 3: Verify successful login
        WebElement welcomeMessage = driver.findElement(By.id("welcomeMessage"));
        try{
        assertTrue("Login was successful", welcomeMessage.isDisplayed());
        //Add logs for each step function with screenshot(ResultID, ActualResultComment , TestStepID, File Screenshot);  
        apptest.addTestLog("passed", "As expected, Welcome Message is shown as "+welcomeMessage.isDisplayed(),3,screenshotFile);
        }catch(Exception e){

Creates a new test run linked to a specific JIRA issue. This method is ideal for tests associated directly with JIRA issues, allowing for automated test run creation within Vansah based on the issue key provided.

- **Parameters**:
  - `testcase`: The test case identifier linked to the JIRA issue.

### `addTestRunFromTestFolder(String testcase)`

Initiates a new test run within a specified test folder. Use this method to organize your test runs within Vansah's folder structure, facilitating structured test management.

- **Parameters**:
  - `testcase`: The identifier of the test case to be included in the test folder.

### `addTestLog(String/Integer result, String comment, Integer testStepRow, File screenshotFile (optional))`

Logs the result of a specific test step, optionally including a comment and a screenshot. This method provides detailed tracking of test execution outcomes.

- **Parameters**:
  - `result`: The outcome of the test step (e.g., PASSED, FAILED)|| (e.g  0 = N/A, 1 = FAIL, 2 = PASS, 3 = Not tested).
  - `comment`: An optional comment describing the test step outcome.
  - `testStepRow`: The index of the test step within the test case.
  - `screenshotFile`: (Optional) The File Object of the screenshot taken to upload : Provide file object or Path of the screenshot.

### `addQuickTestFromJiraIssue(String testcase, int result)` and `addQuickTestFromTestFolders(String testcase, int result)`

Quickly logs the overall result of a test case associated with either a JIRA issue or a test folder. These methods are suited for tests that do not require detailed step-by-step logging.

- **Parameters**:
  - `testcase`: The test case identifier.
  - `result`: The overall test result (e.g., PASS, FAIL).

### `removeTestRun()` and `removeTestLog()`

Deletes a previously created test run or log. These methods are useful for cleaning up data in Vansah that is no longer relevant or was created in error.

### `updateTestLog(String result, String comment, File screenshotFile (optional))`

Updates an existing test log with new information, such as a revised result or an additional comment, and optionally includes a new screenshot.

- **Parameters**:
  - Similar to `addTestLog`, with the same purpose of detailed logging but for updates.

## Setter Methods of Vansah Binding

The `VansahNode` class provides a set of setter methods to configure your test management context before performing operations such as creating test runs, adding test logs, and more. Here's a detailed overview of each setter method:

### `setTESTFOLDERS_ID(String TESTFOLDERS_ID)`

Configures the test folder ID for the VansahNode instance. This ID is essential for associating your test runs and logs with the correct test folder in Vansah.

- **Parameters**:
  - `TESTFOLDERS_ID`: The unique identifier for the test folder in Vansah.

### `setJIRA_ISSUE_KEY(String JIRA_ISSUE_KEY)`

Sets the JIRA issue key. Use this method to link your test runs or logs with a specific issue in Jira, facilitating better traceability and integration between testing and issue tracking.

- **Parameters**:
  - `JIRA_ISSUE_KEY`: The key of the Jira issue you want to associate with your test runs or logs.

### `setSPRINT_NAME(String SPRINT_NAME)`

Defines the sprint name related to the test activities. Setting the sprint name helps in organizing and filtering test results by specific development sprints.

- **Parameters**:
  - `SPRINT_NAME`: The name of the sprint to associate with your test runs or logs.

### `setRELEASE_NAME(String RELEASE_NAME)`

Assigns the release name to the VansahNode instance. This information is used to group test runs and logs under specific release cycles in Vansah, aiding in release management and reporting.

- **Parameters**:
  - `RELEASE_NAME`: The name of the release or version you're testing against.

### `setENVIRONMENT_NAME(String ENVIRONMENT_NAME)`

Sets the testing environment's name. This helps in categorizing and understanding the context of test runs or logs, especially when managing tests across multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

- **Parameters**:
  - `ENVIRONMENT_NAME`: The name of the environment where the tests are executed.

### Usage

To use these setter methods in your application, create an instance of `VansahNode` and call the relevant setter methods with the appropriate values before proceeding with any test management operations. For example:

```java
VansahNode vansahNode = new VansahNode();
vansahNode.setVansahToken("Add your Token here");
vansahNode.setTESTFOLDERS_ID("your-test-folder-id");
vansahNode.setJIRA_ISSUE_KEY("your-jira-issue-key");
vansahNode.setSPRINT_NAME("your-sprint-name");
vansahNode.setRELEASE_NAME("your-release-name");
vansahNode.setENVIRONMENT_NAME("your-environment-name");
```

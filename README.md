## Introduction

Vansah's API can be used to integrate Vansah with various tools, automation and development frameworks including third-party applications. The main usage for the API is to allow our customers to integrate their automated tests and submit test results to Vansah Test Management for Jira. For a full detail of what other tasks you can perform using the API the list can be obtained from this documentation. for moe information on API token required for connecting to Jira see: https://community.vansah.com/posts/how-to-create-a-vansah-api-token-in-jira

## Overview
Vansah's API is HTTP-based and can used from any framework, programming language and tool. Submitting data to Vansah via the API is done via simple POST requests. Requesting data is done through GET requests. All requests and responses use the JSON format and UTF-8 encoding.

All written requests must use the HTTP POST method, and all read requests must use the HTTP GET method. Data is transferred in the JSON format and UTF-8 encoding.

## Authentication
Vansah expects the authentication credentials to be provided via standard HTTP basic authentication for the API.
